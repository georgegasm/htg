CONFIG.JS
Put the links of the Google Spreadsheets to their corresponding variables between the two double quotations "<link>"

Variables with names that starts with show are conditions that gives additional layer of security to the data.
Giving it a value of 1 means you are allowing it to be shown on the pages the spreadsheet is being accessed to.
On the other hand, giving it a value of 0 or any other value will make it unaccessible.
